# FassonAPI

## My semester project
Main idea: to make facial authentication on websites and make API for fast deploy. 

## Programming languages 
All back-end was written on C#, front-end - HTML5 + CSS + JS 

## Used technologies
That projects contains: 
1. ASP.Net Framework for back-end.
2. JQuery for sending data to server.
3. Azure Blob Storage - the vault for user logins, passwords and portraits.
4. webRTC for using webcam in browser.
5. FaceAPI for all manipulations with faces. 

## What's principally original?
In this project contains LITTERALLY ONE possibly good way to use webcam and C# ASP.Net. 
I searched the whole StackOverflow...
All documentation...

##
And, yeap, keys from FaceAPI and Azure Blob Storage still correct [Untill 21 may]
